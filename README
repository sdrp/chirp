their sentiment as a time series. Still in Version 0.1.


Dependencies
------------
Twitter API, TextBlob, matplotlib, numpy


How to Use
----------
From the command line type:
>> python scraper.py [twitter user name] [# of tweets up to 200]

Ex.

Disclaimer
----------
Please generate your own access tokens for the API before using this script
so Twitter doesn't get mad at me. You can get one for free here:
https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens
Then again, it's not like I can stop you at this point.
